# wordsearch
Wordsearch in Python

Algorithm to solve an English wordsearch puzzle of any size. (Uses NLTK's corpus to identify English words)

"fullwordsearch.py" has all the useful code. "randomwordsearchgenerator.py" can generate random wordsearches for testing the code.
Everything else is just scrap, early attempts etc. Not worth looking at.

N.B. NLTK Corpus is a bit oversensitive for what I needed really, so lots of words that aren't in common usage etc. get picked up.
